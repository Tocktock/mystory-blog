There's something magical about old bookstores. This is the story of one rainy afternoon that turned into an unexpected journey through time.

## The Discovery

Hidden between modern buildings, the small bookstore seemed to exist in its own timeline.

## The Collection

Dusty shelves held stories that had waited years to be found again. Each book was a window into another world.

## The Keeper

The elderly owner had stories of her own - tales of the neighborhood's history and the many readers who had passed through her doors.
