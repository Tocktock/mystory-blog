They say gardens teach patience. Mine taught me that and so much more.

## Starting Small

It began with a few herbs on the windowsill - basil, mint, and rosemary.

## Growing Pains

Not everything survived. Each failure was a lesson in resilience.

## The Harvest

The first tomato from my own plant tasted better than any I'd ever bought.
