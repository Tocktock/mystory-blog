## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run audit:web`       | Serve the production build then run Lighthouse, Axe, and Linkinator audits (reports in `.reports/`) |
| `npm run audit:lighthouse`| Run Lighthouse (mobile, performance/accessibility/SEO) against `http://127.0.0.1:4321` |
| `npm run audit:axe`       | Run axe-core accessibility checks against the preview server |
| `npm run audit:links`     | Crawl the preview server and export link check results to `.reports/linkinator/report.json` |

### Phase 0 Audit Toolkit

To establish a measurable baseline, Phase 0 introduces automated audits that run against the production preview:

1. Build the site: `npm run build`.
2. Launch the preview server and full audit suite: `npm run audit:web`.
3. Review generated artifacts under `.reports/`:
   - `lighthouse/report.{html,json}` for performance and SEO scores.
   - `axe/` JSON outputs for accessibility findings (process exits non-zero on violations).
   - `linkinator/report.json` for the internal link crawl.

The audit scripts expect Chrome to be available locally (required by Lighthouse). Each check exits with a non-zero status if failures are detected, making it easy to wire into CI later.
